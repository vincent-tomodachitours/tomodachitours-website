The Company may take measures such as refusing payment of the Service Fee, confiscation as a penalty, suspension of merchant qualifications, cancellation of registration, or termination of the Usage Agreement against merchants who do not provide such procedures, information, and materials, and merchants determined inappropriate by the Company or partner business operators based on review results, and merchants agree to this in advance. In this case, the Company and partner business operators will not disclose the reasons for determining inappropriateness to such merchants.</p>

                                        <p>6. Disputes arising between merchants and purchasers or other third parties based on measures under each paragraph of this Article shall be handled and resolved at the merchant's responsibility, and the Company bears no responsibility for such matters.</p>

                                    <div className='space-y-4'>
                                        <p>1.

                                    <h3 className='text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4'>Article 7: Payment</h3>
                                    <div className='space-y-4'>
                                        <p>1. When making payments of the Service Fee to merchants, the Company may make payments after deducting the usage fees from the previous article. Deducted amounts shall be applied to usage fees.</p>

                                        <p>2. When the Company makes payments of the Service Fee or other payments to merchants, the Company shall make payments to accounts specified by merchants and deemed appropriate by the Company as accounts for making payments to merchants ("Designated Accounts") at any of the times specified by merchants:</p>
                                        <div className='ml-4 space-y-2'>
                                            <p>(1) Closing at the end of each month and making payment by the end of the month following the month to which the closing date belongs</p>
                                            <p>(2) Closing on the 15th and end of each month, making payment for the 15th closing by the end of the month to which the closing date belongs, and making payment for the end-of-month closing by the 15th of the month following the month to which the closing date belongs</p>
                                        </div>
                                        <p>However, if the total amount of the Service Fee is less than 10,000 yen, or if payment cannot be made due to reasons not attributable to the Company, the Company may defer payment to merchants to the next time or later. Merchants cannot designate accounts other than those in their own name as Designated Accounts. Payment obligations of the Company to merchants shall be extinguished by making payments to Designated Accounts, and the same applies even if merchants incorrectly specify Designated Accounts. The Company bears no responsibility for damages incurred by merchants due to incorrect specification of Designated Accounts, and merchants shall bear all costs such as transfer reversal fees arising from incorrect specification of Designated Accounts.</p>

                                        <p>3. Notwithstanding the provisions of the previous paragraph, when separately approved by the Company, merchants may choose the time to request payment rather than receiving payment by the deadlines specified in the previous paragraph. In this case, merchants may request payment when they meet conditions separately determined by the Company, and the Company shall make payment by the end of the month following the month to which the date of such payment request belongs.</p>

                                        <p>4. Transfer fees and other costs necessary for payments under the previous two paragraphs and Paragraph 12 of this Article shall be borne by merchants.</p>

                                        <p>5. Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, when sales contracts are expected to lose effect due to cancellation, revocation, invalidity, or other reasons, when chargebacks or other payment refusal or return reasons determined by partner business operators are expected to occur, when the Company reasonably determines that the effectiveness of debt assignment contracts (as defined in Paragraph 6 of this Article) may be lost under the provisions of Paragraph 9 of this Article, or when other reasonable reasons exist for the Company to reserve payments to merchants, the Company may reserve payments to merchants at its discretion until such reasons are resolved, and merchants agree to this in advance. The Company bears no responsibility for damages incurred by merchants due to measures specified in this paragraph.</p>

                                        <p>6. When product payment claims are established based on sales contracts, merchants shall immediately transfer such product payment claims to the Company (the contract related to this transfer is referred to as "Debt Assignment Contract," and the payment the Company makes to merchants based on such contract is referred to as "Service Fee"), and agree to grant the Company authority to transfer such product payment claims to partner business operators and to receive money related to such product payment claims on behalf of merchants.</p>

                                        <p>7. The Company shall transfer the Service Fee to accounts of financial institutions designated by merchants on the dates specified in Paragraphs 2, 3, or 12 of this Article.</p>

                                        <p>8. Credit card merchant fees that merchants should pay to partner business operators shall be paid by the Company to partner business operators using all or part of the Service usage fees that merchants pay to the Company based on Article 6.</p>

                                        <p>9. When sales contracts lose effect due to cancellation, revocation, invalidity, or other reasons (including cases that fall under chargeback reasons determined by partner business operators), or when the Company shows reasonable reasons to merchants, debt assignment contracts shall immediately and retroactively lose effect, and merchants must immediately refund amounts that the Company paid to merchants in relation to such sales contracts. In this case, the Company may deduct such refund amounts from amounts to be paid to merchants at the Company's discretion.</p>

                                        <p>10. When the Company determines that merchants' transactions are fraudulent, such as merchants and purchasers colluding, the Company may take measures such as canceling debt assignment contracts, refusing payments, suspending merchant qualifications, or canceling registration, and merchants agree to this in advance. In this case, merchants cannot receive payments specified in this Article unless they submit materials showing that such transactions are not fraudulent in content approved by the Company. The Company bears no responsibility for damages incurred by merchants due to measures specified in this paragraph.</p>

                                        <p>11. When payments cannot be made by the deadlines specified in this Article due to system troubles or other reasons, the Company shall endeavor to make payments promptly.</p>

                                        <p>12. When one year has passed since deferral began due to the total amount of the Service Fee being less than 10,000 yen as specified in Paragraph 2 of this Article, or when one year has passed since merchants became able to request payment as specified in Paragraph 3 of this Article and the Company notified merchants to make payment requests but no payment requests were made by merchants, the Company shall make payments by transfer to Designated Accounts. If, based on this paragraph, the Company conducts transfer procedures but transfers are not completed normally due to reasons not attributable to the Company, or if the total amount of the Service Fee is less than 1,000 yen, the Company may deem that merchants have waived payment claim rights related to such payments, and merchants' rights to request such payments shall be extinguished.</p>

                                        <p>13. When one year has passed since deferral began due to inability to make payments for reasons not attributable to the Company as specified in Paragraph 2 of this Article, and merchants have not contacted the Company to correct Designated Accounts and payments of the Service Fee are expected to be impossible, the Company may deem that merchants have waived payment claim rights related to such payments, and merchants' rights to request such payments shall be extinguished.</p>

                                        <p>14. When the total amount of the Service Fee is 1,000 yen or more and no payment requests are made by merchants after Usage Agreements with merchants are terminated, the Company shall make payments by transfer to Designated Accounts. If, based on this paragraph, the Company conducts transfer procedures but transfers are not completed normally due to reasons not attributable to the Company, or if the total amount of the Service Fee is less than 1,000 yen, the Company may deem that merchants have waived payment claim rights related to such payments, and merchants' rights to request such payments shall be extinguished.</p>
