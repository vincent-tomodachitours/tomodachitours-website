BUT! who could answer my "WHY"s. Why this way, but not another? Why the tradition was established this way, but not another, and HIRO guide COULD answer all of my "why"s. Very knowledgeable and round educated person with very fluent English and out-going personality. I also want to mention that he answered all of my not connected to the tour agenda OFF-TOPIC questions such as: What is the Ikigai? What Japanese books and authors would you recommend to start getting to know Japanese literature? He gave me book recommendations, I\'m so grateful and would recommend this guide to anyone who comes to Kyoto and searches for the answers he struggles to find him/herself!',

We were fortunate to have private tour for two which allowed us to ask questions, hear detailed history, and enjoy a personalized experience. We were able to capture great photos and our guide was gracious enough to take our pictures and recommend the best photo ops! Caleb was knowledgeable, accommodating, and made the tour truly memorable. We highly recommend this tour, especially early in the day during warmer months to avoid crowds. Overall, a wonderful experience!',

The tour includes the travel time to Uji via train which is only ~20mins.

Vincent really liked doing research on the area including throwing some tidbits about the architecture in the streets and by the river. All in all a great tour. Thank you!',
