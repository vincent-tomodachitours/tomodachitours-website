# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves gradually migrating the customer site from JavaScript to TypeScript to improve code quality, developer experience, and maintainability. The migration will be done incrementally to ensure system stability and allow for testing at each step.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up TypeScript configuration for the customer site, so that I can begin the gradual migration process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript is configured THEN the system SHALL support both .js and .ts files during the transition
2. WHEN TypeScript configuration is added THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing JavaScript files
3. WHEN TypeScript is set up THEN the system SHALL provide proper type checking and IntelliSense support
4. WHEN building the project THEN the system SHALL compile TypeScript files to JavaScript without breaking existing functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate utility and service files first, so that I can establish type definitions for core functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating service files THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality
2. WHEN adding type definitions THEN the system SHALL improve code documentation and IDE support
3. WHEN migrating utilities THEN the system SHALL provide better error detection at compile time
4. WHEN service files are converted THEN the system SHALL export proper TypeScript interfaces for other files to use

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate React components gradually, so that I can maintain UI functionality while improving type safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN converting JSX to TSX THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing component behavior
2. WHEN adding prop types THEN the system SHALL provide compile-time validation of component usage
3. WHEN migrating components THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing styling and functionality
4. WHEN component migration is complete THEN the system SHALL provide better development experience with type hints

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to establish a migration strategy with phases, so that I can track progress and ensure stability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migration phases are defined THEN the system SHALL allow for incremental conversion
2. WHEN each phase is completed THEN the system SHALL be fully functional and testable
3. WHEN migration conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and resolution paths
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL have full TypeScript coverage with no JavaScript files remaining

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain build and deployment processes during migration, so that the production system remains stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript files are added THEN the build process SHALL compile them correctly
2. WHEN the build runs THEN the system SHALL produce the same output structure as before
3. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality
4. WHEN type errors occur THEN the build process SHALL fail with clear error messages to prevent broken deployments
