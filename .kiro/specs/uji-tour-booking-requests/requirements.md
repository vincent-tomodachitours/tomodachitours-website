# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a booking request system specifically for the Uji tour, where customers submit booking requests that require manual confirmation before payment processing. Unlike other tours that have instant confirmation, the Uji tour requires availability verification through a third-party company, necessitating a request-approval workflow with deferred payment processing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to submit a booking request for the Uji tour, so that I can reserve a spot pending availability confirmation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a customer selects the Uji tour THEN the system SHALL display a "Request Booking" flow instead of instant booking
2. WHEN a customer completes the Uji tour booking form THEN the system SHALL create a booking request with status "pending_confirmation"
3. WHEN a customer submits a booking request THEN the system SHALL NOT charge their payment method immediately
4. WHEN a booking request is submitted THEN the system SHALL send a confirmation email to the customer explaining the request process
5. WHEN a booking request is created THEN the system SHALL store all booking details including customer information, tour date, and payment method token

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to review and approve/reject Uji tour booking requests, so that I can confirm availability before processing payment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a booking request is submitted THEN the system SHALL notify admins via email or dashboard notification
2. WHEN an admin views the booking requests THEN the system SHALL display all pending Uji tour requests with customer details
3. WHEN an admin approves a booking request THEN the system SHALL process the payment using the stored payment method
4. WHEN an admin rejects a booking request THEN the system SHALL cancel the request without charging the customer
5. WHEN a booking request is approved or rejected THEN the system SHALL send an email notification to the customer
6. WHEN payment processing fails after approval THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and notify both admin and customer

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to receive clear communication about my booking request status, so that I understand the process and next steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a booking request is submitted THEN the customer SHALL receive an immediate confirmation email with request details
2. WHEN a booking request is approved THEN the customer SHALL receive a booking confirmation email with payment receipt
3. WHEN a booking request is rejected THEN the customer SHALL receive a rejection email with explanation
4. WHEN payment fails after approval THEN the customer SHALL receive an email explaining the issue and next steps
5. IF a booking request is not processed within 24 hours THEN the system SHALL send a follow-up email to the customer

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the booking request system to integrate seamlessly with existing payment and booking infrastructure, so that it doesn't disrupt other tour bookings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN customers book non-Uji tours THEN the system SHALL continue to process instant confirmations as before
2. WHEN the system processes Uji tour requests THEN it SHALL use the existing Stripe payment infrastructure
3. WHEN booking requests are created THEN they SHALL integrate with the existing booking database schema
4. WHEN admins manage requests THEN they SHALL use the existing admin dashboard interface
5. WHEN booking confirmations are sent THEN they SHALL use the existing email notification system

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to track booking request metrics and conversion rates, so that I can optimize the request-to-booking process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN booking requests are submitted THEN the system SHALL log request creation events
2. WHEN requests are approved or rejected THEN the system SHALL track approval/rejection rates
3. WHEN payments are processed after approval THEN the system SHALL track successful conversion rates
4. WHEN requests time out or fail THEN the system SHALL log failure reasons for analysis
5. WHEN admins view analytics THEN they SHALL see booking request performance metrics
