# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a simple clock in/clock out system to the admin interface for managing employee shifts and payroll. The system will track when employees start and end their work shifts, allow them to add todos and notes, and provide monthly payroll summaries that can be downloaded by administrators.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to clock in when I start my shift, so that my work hours are accurately tracked for payroll purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin user accesses the timesheet system THEN the system SHALL display a "Clock In" button if they are not currently clocked in
2. WHEN an admin user clicks "Clock In" THEN the system SHALL record their name, current date and time, and create a new timesheet entry
3. WHEN an admin user clocks in THEN the system SHALL allow them to optionally add a todo item for their shift
4. WHEN an admin user is clocked in THEN the system SHALL display their current status and the time they clocked in

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to clock out when I finish my shift, so that my total work hours are calculated correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin user is clocked in THEN the system SHALL display a "Clock Out" button
2. WHEN an admin user clicks "Clock Out" THEN the system SHALL record the current date and time as their clock out time
3. WHEN an admin user clocks out THEN the system SHALL allow them to optionally add notes about their shift
4. WHEN an admin user clocks out THEN the system SHALL calculate and display the total hours worked for that shift
5. WHEN an admin user clocks out THEN the system SHALL return them to the clocked out state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to view all timesheet entries in a table format, so that I can monitor employee attendance and hours worked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the timesheet management page THEN the system SHALL display a table with columns for Name, Clock-in, Todo, Clock-out, and Note
2. WHEN displaying timesheet entries THEN the system SHALL show the most recent entries first
3. WHEN an employee is currently clocked in THEN the system SHALL indicate their active status in the table
4. WHEN displaying clock-in and clock-out times THEN the system SHALL format them in a readable date and time format

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to download monthly payroll summaries for each employee, so that I can process payroll efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator selects an employee and month THEN the system SHALL generate a summary of all their timesheet entries for that period
2. WHEN generating a monthly summary THEN the system SHALL calculate total hours worked, number of shifts, and average shift length
3. WHEN an administrator clicks the download button THEN the system SHALL export the summary as a CSV or PDF file
4. WHEN downloading a summary THEN the file SHALL include employee name, month/year, detailed shift records, and calculated totals
5. WHEN no timesheet data exists for the selected period THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the system to prevent duplicate clock-ins, so that timesheet data remains accurate and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin user is already clocked in THEN the system SHALL NOT allow them to clock in again
2. WHEN an admin user tries to clock out without being clocked in THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
3. WHEN the system detects an inconsistent state THEN it SHALL provide options to resolve the issue
4. WHEN displaying current status THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate whether the user is clocked in or out

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the timesheet data to be stored securely in the database, so that payroll information is protected and persistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN timesheet data is created THEN the system SHALL store it in a dedicated database table with proper data types
2. WHEN storing timesheet entries THEN the system SHALL ensure data integrity and prevent corruption
3. WHEN accessing timesheet data THEN the system SHALL enforce proper authentication and authorization
4. WHEN the database is queried THEN the system SHALL use efficient queries to maintain performance
